# Cross Correlation

## Background
(im not sure what's appropriate for background vs overview. also feel free to delete or rewrite this) 

Climate change is one of the top issues of today, because not only is it a global issue, but it also affects all species due to mostly human activity. Tracking species can help us gauge how much climate change has hurt these populations and the undergoing changes in their habitats and ecosystem. Our focus are on birds and weâ€™re hoping to use bird audio to measure the biodiversity of birds within our area and potentially identify endangered birds. 

However, the issue is that these models need labeled and identified audio recordings which require manual input and time. My section saw this as we had to manually label over 200 birds clips. This process can be very time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies due to human input error, negatively impacting the model. 

Our solution is the cross correlation pipeline, which helps to label the data automatically. Cross correlation takes in a template audio clip and runs it across other audio clips to find similarities in peaks; these similarities allow us to identify the same species. 

If we can improve the workflow and speed up the process of gathering training data without sacrificing accuracy, we will be able to gather intel on the biodiversity of species. Monitoring wildlife gives us a better understanding of rare, threatened, or endangered species to help us reallocate funds and provide assistance and protection to those species that need it.

### Data

The datasets that we are using has been collected by the San Diego Zoo, which contain .wav files of bird audio from different forests. (idk what else to say lol) 

Each dataset the San Diego Zoo Conservation Technology Lab (CTL) shares with UCSD Engineers for Exploration will remain the property of San Diego Zoo Wildlife Alliance (SDZWA) and cannot be shared or disseminated any further without first following up with the CTL.
